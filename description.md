* Demo Area: Implement a Test Generator
* Main Idea of the Demo: 
    1. I would like to implement critical test case generation for stress testing Self-Driving Cars.
    2. Based on the Crashes/Paper 01, I would like to reuse the NLP material to implement information extraction from the Traffic Crash Reports, then re-produce corresponding crashes. This implementation will include environmental elements such as weather, lightning, and so on.
    3. Planning: 
        * Implementing the simple configuration of a typical crash on BeamNG.AI
        * Implementing the information extraction for some sample police reports to re-produce the corresponding configuration 
        * Find suitable metrics to validate the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation.
